**I'm Elis, and this my projects den.** You may find here projects small, large, problematic, unstarted; projects borne of spur-of-the-moment ideas and taken too far.

If they spur thoughts on where to take them next, or critiques on how I've done things, please get in touch - I'd be very happy to hear from you.

**A bit about me:** I enjoy being creative, and sometimes that includes playing around with tech. I'm an aerospace engineer by background, working in energy modelling. I'm doing my best to align my love for the outdoors with my knees' tendency to be injured in it.
