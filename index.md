**I'm Elis**, an aerospace engineer by background working in energy modelling. In my spare time I enjoy running, hiking, and other outdoors pursuits, when my knees feel so inclined. When not, I'm likely to be planning or working on a creative (and usually tech-y) project.

This is an outlet for those creative spells, **my projects den**. You may find here projects small, large, problematic, unstarted; projects borne of spur-of-the-moment ideas and taken too far.

If they spur thoughts on where to take them next, or how I could have done something differently and better, please get in touch. Iâ€™d be very happy to hear from you.
